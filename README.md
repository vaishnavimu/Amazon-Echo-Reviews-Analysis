# **Amazon Echo Reviews Sentiment Analysis**

## Overview

This project is a hands-on endeavor aimed at training a Naive Bayes classifier model to perform sentiment analysis on reviews related to the Amazon Echo product. 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are employed to convert text data into numerical form, which is then utilized to train the machine learning model. 
The trained model can predict the sentiment of customer reviews, providing valuable insights for companies to understand customer opinions about their products and services.

## Learning Objectives

Gain understanding of Python programming fundamentals for Natural Language Processing. 
Construct a pipeline to preprocess text data, including steps such as stop-word removal, tokenization, and padding. 
Train and evaluate Naive Bayes Classifier Models for sentiment analysis.
